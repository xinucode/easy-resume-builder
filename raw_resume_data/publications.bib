abstract = {We analyze the clustering of galaxies in the first public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. Despite the relatively small footprints of the observed fields, the data are an excellent proxy for the very deep photometric datasets that will be acquired by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and are therefore an ideal test bed for the analysis methods being implemented by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. We select a magnitude limited sample with i&lt;24.5 and analyze it in four tomographic redshift bins covering the range 0.15≲ z≲1.5. We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the two-point clustering of this sample, including all auto- and cross-correlations between bins. We demonstrate the use of map-level deprojection methods to account for non-physical fluctuations in the galaxy number density caused by observational systematics. Through a halo occupation distribution analysis, we place constraints on the characteristic halo masses of this sample as a function of redshift, finding a good fit up to scales kmax=1 Mpc−1, including both auto- and cross-correlations. Our results show monotonically decreasing average halo masses with increasing redshift, which can be interpreted in terms of the drop-out of red galaxies at high redshifts for a flux-limited sample, consistent with previous analyses. In terms of photometric redshift systematics, we show that additional care is needed in order to marginalize over uncertainties in the redshift distribution in galaxy clustering, even for samples of this small size, and that these uncertainties can be significantly constrained by including cross-bin correlations. We are able to make a ∼3σ detection of the effects of lensing magnification in the HSC data. Our results are stable to variations in the amplitude of density fluctuations σ8 and the cold dark matter abundance Ωc and we find constraints that agree well with measurements from Planck and low-redshift probes. Finally, we use our analysis pipeline to study the clustering of galaxies as a function of limiting flux, and provide a simple fitting function for the linear galaxy bias for magnitude limited samples as a function of limiting magnitude and redshift.}

abstract = {Elastic nucleon-pion scattering amplitudes are computed using lattice QCD on a single ensemble of gauge field configurations with Nf=2+1 dynamical quark flavors and mπ=200MeV. The s-wave scattering lengths with both total isospins I=1/2 and I=3/2 are inferred from the finite-volume spectrum below the inelastic threshold together with the I=3/2 p-wave containing the Δ(1232) resonance. The amplitudes are well-described by the effective range expansion with parameters constrained by fits to the finite-volume energy levels, enabling a determination of the I=3/2 scattering length with statistical errors below 5%, while the I=1/2 scattering length is somewhat less precisely evaluated. Systematic errors due to excited states and the influence of higher partial waves are controlled, providing a step toward future computations down to physical light quark masses with multiple lattice spacings and volumes.}
